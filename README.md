## Application rules/Operation

This is an application that runs through a complex object populated with a series of Horror Movie Trivia questions. The user initiatlizes the quiz with a start button on the main page. The app sets a 30 second timer which displays for the user when the first question pops up. They choose their answer by clicking one of the buttons below the question with their chosen answer. The app then notifies the user if they are correct or not, and shows an image from the selected film. If they run out of time, the question is marked unanswered and the app shows the correct answer and then moves to the next question. After moving through all questions, the application goes to a final score screen showing the users results and repopulates the start button so the application can be restarted.

## Acknowledgements

A very big thank you to Ben Provow. Having an experienced programmer to ask questions and help you understand the logic you are trying to untangle was invaluable and I would not have been able to complete this project without his guidance and encouragement.
